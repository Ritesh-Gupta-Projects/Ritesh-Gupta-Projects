# Simple Calculator

A **Simple Calculator** application built using Java that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to create a simple, console-based calculator that accepts two numeric inputs from the user and performs an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) based on the user's choice. This project demonstrates basic Java concepts like user input handling, conditional statements, and switch-case control flow.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to input two numbers.
2. The user selects an arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. The program calculates the result and displays it.
4. If the user selects division, the program ensures that division by zero is handled by displaying an appropriate error message.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A text editor or an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository or download the code.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd simple-calculator
   ```
3. Compile the Java file.
   ```bash
   javac SimpleCalculator.java
   ```
4. Run the compiled Java program.
   ```bash
   java SimpleCalculator
   ```

## Code Example

```java
public class SimpleCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

- Implement support for additional operations like modulus and exponentiation.
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing or JavaFX for a better user experience.
- Include functionality to handle multiple calculations in a single session.
